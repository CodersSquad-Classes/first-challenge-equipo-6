# There's no documentation on how to compile/run your program

The `README.md` file should be updated

## Testing machine
I'm using a Linux Distribution OS: Ubuntu 24.04.2

## Update - 2025-03-03

- The program is not running, it gets killed just at the beginning, there's no output files
- You can see the `test#-time.txt` files to get the terminal output

## Final Grading - 2025-03-06

- Didn't pass the required tests, the program didn't run as explained on last update
